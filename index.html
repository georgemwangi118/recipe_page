                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <div>
                    <span class="instruction">1</span>
                    <p>Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).</p>
                </div><br>
                <div>
                    <span class="instruction">2</span>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Make the crust: </strong>Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into crumbs. 
                        Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it 
                        all together in the food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and 
                        slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I 
                        use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove 
                        from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around 
                        the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.
                    </p>
                </div><br>
                <div>
                    <span class="instruction">3</span>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Make the filling: </strong>Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle 
                        attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large 
                        bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, 
                        and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, 
                        beating after each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the 
                        batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid 
                        over-mixing the batter as best you can.
                    </p>
                </div><br>
                <div>
                    <span class="instruction">4</span>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Prepare the simple water bath (see note) </strong>Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch 
                        of water in your roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire 
                        kettle of hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan. 
                        Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an 
                        even layer. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of 
                        the pan and place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the 
                        hot water in. Whichever is easier for you.)
                    </p>
                </div><br>
                <div>
                    <span class="instruction">5</span>
                    <p>
                        Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. When it’s done, the center 
                        of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open 
                        the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. 
                        Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room temperature. Then refrigerate 
                        the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.
                    </p>
                </div><br>
                <div>
                    <span class="instruction">6</span>
                    <p>
                        Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a 
                        clean sharp knife, cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and dip into warm water 
                        between each slice.
                    </p>
                </div><br>
                <div>
                    <span class="instruction">7</span>
                    <p>
                        Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
